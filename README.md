## COVID-19 Dashboard
A dashboard in the context of my thesis entitled "COVID-19 in figures: how the Greek economy & society are experiencing the pandemic".

### Purpose
The primary purpose of this tool is to use it as a dynamic information tool for the design of future policies and measures, while monitoring the multifaceted developments concerning epidemiological elements, key economic variables, as well as citizens' perceptions, in Greece. 

### File structure
* The app.py file contains code which, firstly, creates an instance of the Dash class and, secondly, calls the WSGI server (Gunicorn), which is a server for developing and hosting web applications (web apps), written in the Python programming language.
* The index.py file contains the code that links all the pages together and runs the application locally.
* The apps folder contains 5 files, 4 of them contain the code for each separate page, meaning the pages arxiki.py, pandimia.py, oikonomia.py and koinwnia.py, as well as the empty init.py file, which is necessary as it enables the application to read these 4 pages.
* The assets folder contains a CSS file, useful for the dashboard style, and some images used in the dashboard.
* The datasets folder contains all the dataset files used to create the graphs.
* The above architecture had as main source of inspiration a didactic Youtube video created by the "Charming Data" channel. The video is titled «Build and Deploy your Multipage App with Dash Plotly», and can be found at:
